 This application had a couple features. First, help the user understand how to use the program by printed a help menu in the console. The first command, HTTPRequest, gets URL contents from a website. My feature, HTTPRequestIndex takes the URL contents from the index,, parses all the URL's, and gets the content from each URL, Then, it's all printed to the console  and timed for how long it took. 

This is my completed swissarmyknife project. email me if you have any questions about what I did. kwintynmporter@lewisu.edu

HTTPRequestURLs and HTTPRequestIndex are line for line the exact same code, they're both in there because I was a bit confused on the implemented of what to call in the main.
